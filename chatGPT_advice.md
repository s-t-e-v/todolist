Hi!

Hello! How can I help you today?

**Steven Bandaogo**
I am doing a todo app running on browsers. I would like my web app to be dynamic, i.e. no reloading when performing an action on it. I intend to use Django. Is it a good idea?

Yes, using Django as a backend with JavaScript as the frontend can allow you to build a dynamic web application that does not require reloading the page when performing actions. You can use Django to serve a JSON API that the JavaScript frontend can interact with to update the data displayed on the page.

Here are some steps you can follow to build a dynamic todo app using Django and JavaScript:

1. Set up a Django project and create a Todo model to store the tasks.
2. Use Django's views and URL routes to handle requests for the todo data and actions such as creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
3. Create a JavaScript frontend that makes requests to the Django backend to retrieve and update the todo data.
4. Use JavaScript to update the HTML of the page dynamically based on the todo data and user actions.

Django is a powerful framework that can help you quickly build a backend for your web application, and it is well-suited for building APIs to be consumed by JavaScript frontends.
